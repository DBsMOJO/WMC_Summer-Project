## Initial Situation

As a school project, we are tasked with creating a website. It seemed like an ideal opportunity to have my son create a website.

Despite his young age, my son is already uploading (anonymous) videos to the internet via the YouTube platform. Moreover, he has an interest in programming, and I want to hand over this website to him as a live project, allowing him to gain practical experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.

The website should provide an overview of his content, allowing him to upload additional images or even provide a link to a Minecraft server hosted by me.

For me, it's an educational exercise to design this website, while for my son, it serves as an entry point into the IT world, fostering creativity and practical skills.

## Opportunity

This project can be taken over by my son and further maintained, transforming it from a theoretical school project into a real-world endeavor. It's well-suited to his current skill level, offering opportunities for growth, making it meaningful both personally and academically.

## Concept

The website should be kept simple and well-structured, catering to a younger audience without overwhelming them. Through color schemes and layout, it should immediately convey its focus: Minecraft.

The main page should prominently display the latest and favorite content of my son for easy user access. Users can then navigate to pages containing all video content or images.

The project serves as a foundation, with additional content to be added in the future, such as:

- Link to the self-hosted Minecraft server
- World map or exploration status of the self-hosted Minecraft server
- Dedicated page for Minecraft crafting recipes or other collections of links
- ...

## Marketing

My son will handle marketing on the "schoolyard" or on YouTube, among relatives, friends, or followers.

## Planning

The planning will be done in parallel with the SYP project, following its format.

## Resources

The time invested contributes to academic success, allowing me to utilize the school project for personal purposes as well.

## Financing

I will cover the expenses for operation. This includes acquiring a domain and setting up a server within a separate network, independent of personal systems.

## Operation

My son will primarily handle the operation. I will provide ongoing assistance to support the project.

## Opportunities

This project allows me to achieve positive results in school while also sparking my son's interest in web design.

## Risks

As it is a school project, it might not receive as much acceptance due to its "childish" nature. It might also demand too much from my son, and due to time constraints, I might not be able to support him adequately in the required quality.
