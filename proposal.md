## Initial Situation

As I embarked on this school project, I made a deliberate decision to involve my son, recognizing it as an excellent opportunity to blend his burgeoning interests with practical learning. Despite his young age, he's already active in the online realm, anonymously sharing videos on platforms like YouTube. Moreover, his burgeoning interest in programming made this project a natural fit to nurture his skills while also fulfilling academic requirements.

## Opportunity

This project extends beyond a mere school assignment; it's a gateway for my son to delve into the world of web design and development in a meaningful way. By transitioning it from a theoretical exercise to a tangible, ongoing project, he gains not only practical experience but also a sense of ownership and responsibility, essential for his growth both academically and personally.

## Concept

At its core, this website serves as a practical manifestation of our school project, ensuring its relevance beyond the classroom. Our focus is on simplicity and clarity, catering to a younger audience with a passion for Minecraft. The homepage will prominently feature my son's latest content, providing easy navigation for users. Furthermore, we envision expanding its offerings over time, incorporating elements like links to a self-hosted Minecraft server and related content such as crafting recipes, to enhance user engagement.

## Marketing

Our marketing strategy revolves around grassroots efforts, leveraging connections within the school community and my son's online presence to generate interest and engagement. This includes promoting the website among peers, family, and his YouTube audience, fostering a sense of community around his content.

## Resources

The investment of time and effort in this project not only fulfills academic requirements but also serves as a platform for practical skill development. It's an invaluable opportunity for my son to gain hands-on experience in web design and programming, setting a solid foundation for his future endeavors in the field.

## Financing

To ensure the sustainability of the project, I'm committed to covering the necessary expenses, including acquiring a domain and setting up a server. This investment ensures a dedicated and independent platform for the website, free from reliance on personal systems.

## Operation

My son's involvement in the design process is substantial, allowing him to contribute actively to the project's development. While he primarily focuses on design aspects, he also has opportunities to observe programming tasks, providing him with a holistic understanding of website development. This balanced approach ensures his engagement while allowing him to manage his other commitments effectively.

## Opportunities and Risks

The potential benefits of this project are vast, ranging from academic achievement to fostering my son's passion for web design. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the associated risks, including potential challenges in perception and support within the allotted timeframe. By addressing these risks proactively, we aim to maximize the project's success and impact.

As it is a school project, it might not receive as much acceptance due to its "childish" nature. It might also demand too much from my son, and due to time constraints, I might not be able to support him adequately in the required quality.
